# Authentication
We use token-based authentication. To get a token for your session, see the [Authentication](./api-reference/authentication) page.

This token must be included in subsequent requests as a bearer token:

```bash
'Authorization': 'Bearer <team_token>'
```


# Environments
Axle provides **sandbox** environments for testing and development purposes. We'll be using
one of these to get started.

When you're ready to roll with a **production** environment, please [get in touch with the team](mailto:founders@axle.energy).


## Creating a new sandbox
The API credentials you received upon signing up can be used to create and delete an unlimited number of sandbox environments.

Create a new sandbox via `POST` to the `/environments` endpoint.
