## Market
A market is a specific type of product (e.g. frequency response) within a specific geography (e.g. NL).

Each market has a set of participation requirements and reimbursement schemes. Requirements are defined both at the **pool** and **asset** level.

We associate each market with a list of **eligible assets**. These are assets that could be **registered** to participate in the market, if so desired.

## Geography
Markets sit within specific geographies. Different geographies may procure similar products (e.g. frequency response) under different names.

## Assets
An asset is a source of flexible load such as an electric vehicle, HVAC system, or battery. When you register an asset you need to supply 
a webhook that we can call if the asset is called upon by the market.

# Events

## Registering eligible assets
All eligible assets for a particular market are added to a "virtual pool" for that market. If desired, they can then be registered to that market.

This pool of eligible assets correspond to assets that meet the prequalification criteria for that market.

## Forecasting pool availability
Distributed energy assets have unpredictable availability over time. axle forecasts the availability of each asset based upon the data 
you provide, and combines them to a market-level availability forecast. Alternatively, if you have an availability forecast that you are 
confident in, you can supply this.

## Placing bids
Based upon the availability forecast for each market, we compute the optimal bidding strategy for each assets taking into account *all* the 
markets in which that asset participates. 

## Activation
If an asset is activated, we will call the supplied webhook in order to turn the asset up or down by the specified amount. We will then await 
confirmation that the action has been taken.
