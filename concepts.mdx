# Entities
## Market
A market is a specific type of product (e.g. frequency response) within a specific geography (e.g. NL).

Each market has a set of participation requirements and reimbursement schemes. Requirements are defined both at the **pool** and **asset** level.

## Geography
Markets sit within specific geographies. Different geographies may procure similar products (e.g. frequency response) under different names.

## Pool
A pool is a collection of **assets**, grouped together for the purpose of participating in a **market**. By pooling assets we meet 
minimum size requirements, and gain the ability to make probabilistic forecasts of availability: even if one particular asset is unavailable, in a 
large pool of assets we can place high-confidence bids on the availability of some fraction.

## Assets
An asset is a source of flexible load such as an electric vehicle, HVAC system, or battery.

# Events
## Grouping assets into pools
Assets in the same **geography** and with similar response characteristics are added to **pools**. At present, an asset can only
be registered to a single pool. When creating a pool, you can specify the eligibility requirements, allowing automated rejection of assets.

For instance, in a particular geography, you might establish two pools of assets depending upon the speed with which they respond 
to commands. 

## Prequalifying pools
Access to markets go via a **prequalification** step in the properties of the pool and constituent assets are verified against the requirements of 
that market. Axle performs the prequalification on your behalf.

## Registering pools
Post prequalification, a pool is registered to participate in a particular market. This subscribes the pool to the conditions of that 
market, and corresponding payments.
