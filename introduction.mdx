## Getting Started
### Overview

<Tip>
  You can find an overview of our currently supported markets in the [Markets](markets) section.
</Tip>

Axle provides API access to flexibility markets across Europe. **Assets** are registered to **pools**,
which are the unit of participation in these markets. Each market is associated with a set of **prequalification** criteria
which must be met by each asset individually, and by the pool as a whole. These are properties such as response time (e.g. 30s), minimum duration of 
activation (e.g. 20mins), and minimum pool size (e.g. 1MW).

Participation is rewarded with **availability payments**
and **utilization payments** depending upon the details of each market.
